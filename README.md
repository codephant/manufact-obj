# ManufactObj.js

is aiming to make the work with ES's object manipulation functions (most
importantly *Object.defineProperty*) easier by wrapping it in a nicer API
and putting some sprinkles on top here and there.
Hopefully this makes for a more readable and fun-to-handle source code.


## Todo until v1.0.0

*   Add Decorators/Annotations
    *   think about meaningful ends for separation of object and metadata
